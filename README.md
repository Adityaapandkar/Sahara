# Sahara - An app for the elderly
 
During the last decade, there has been an increase in studies describing use of mHealth, using smartphones with apps, in the healthcare system by a variety of populations. Despite this, few interventions including apps are targeting older people receiving home care. Developing mobile technology to its full potential of being interactive in real time remains a challenge. The current study is part of a larger project for identifying and managing health concerns via an app by using real-time data.

Our app is designed to be used by old people. The main purpose of our app is to provide the elderly a place which has all necessary information. Our app currently has features like emergency contacts, nearby hospitals location, medicine info. The emergency contacts are completely customizable by the user.
